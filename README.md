# Flute 3.1

Flute 3.1 with UTD improvments using CMake instead of Fred Flintstone
era autotools support, remove UTD utility dependency, restore original
test programs rand-pts and flute-net.

### UTD-flute

This repository contains the original flute (unused) and a streamlined
version which is reentrant and dynamic, that is MAXD has been completely
eliminated.   In addition, there are no known memory leaks and the
library has been tested using Purify.  Originally, FLUTE was written
using stack memory and was subject to stack size limitations.  It
was observed that this coding could fail with net sizes as small as
345 with MAXD set to 1000 and was input dependent.  This library 
does not encode the lookup tables into the binary but reads them 
from files.   The advantage is that 29MB of memory can be freed when
the flute object is freed.

Here are some results running on a 2014 Mac 2.8Ghz Intel Core i7 with
16GB DDR3 RAM:

To run the programs, first do a 'make'. POWV9.dat and POST9.dat is assume
to be in the current directory.  Some example commands:

 rand-pts | flute-net
 rand-pts 20 | flute-net	    // 20-pin nets
 rand-pts -r 20 | flute-net	    // randomized
 flute-ckt ibm01 ibm01.aux ibm01/ibm01.pl
